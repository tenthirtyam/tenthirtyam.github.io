The 9th annual VMworld launched with at literal bang during the VMworld 2012 opening General Session on Monday morning. Many announcements were made and here is a recap of the announcements, releases and updates.

###VMware vCloud Suite 5.1 – Delivering the Software-Defined Data Center

Perhaps one of the more exciting announcements made today at VMworld, Paul Maritz, Pat Gelsinger and Steve Herrod [unveiled](http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/vmw-vmworld-vcloud-suite-082712.html) the [VMware vCloud Suite 5.1](https://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcloud-suite/overview.htm) – the first solution to deliver the software-defined datacenter. The VMware vCloud suite integrates virtualization, cloud infrastructure and management portfolio into a single SKU, in order to simplify the adoption of cloud era technologies.

The VMware vCloud Suite to simplify IT operations and deliver the best SLAs for all of your applications. Now, you can build a complete infrastructure-as-a-service cloud and operationalize your VMware environment, becoming more responsive to business.

vCloud Suite is part of the complete VMware cloud solution, a comprehensive set of technology, services intellectual property, and skills enhancements based on real-world deployment experience. The integrated offering includes everything you need to build (technology and architecture), operate (processes and control) and staff (people and organization) a cloud environment while measuring the improvements (IT business management) of cloud computing.

Paul Maritz shared during VMworld, *“VMware and its partners are taking a bold step toward simplifying IT, offering customers everything they need to build, operate and manage their cloud environments. The VMware vCloud Suite delivers the software-defined datacenter – the architecture for implementing cloud computing.”*

As Steve Herrod mentioned, available in three flavors of [Standard, Advanced and Enterprise editions](http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcloud-suite/compare.html), the vCloud Suite includes:

* [VMware vSphere 5.1](http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vsphere/overview.html") — Enhance IT agility, reduce costs and improve service availability. vSphere is at the heart of the Software-Defined Datacenter, designed to deliver the peak of automation, flexibility and optimized efficiency for every application.

* [VMware vCloud Director 5.1](http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcloud-director/overview.html) — Orchestrate the provisioning of Software-Defined Datacenter services to deliver complete virtual datacenters for easy consumption in minutes. Fundamentally simplify infrastructure provisioning and enable IT to move at the speed of business.

* [VMware vCloud Connector](http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcloudconnector/overview.html) — Extend your cloud with vCloud Connector 1.5. View, operate on and transfer your computing resources across vSphere and vCloud Director in your private cloud environment, as well as public clouds from vCloud Service Providers. New Advanced 2.0 functionality will improve public cloud extensibility.

* [VMware vCenter Operations Management Suite 5.0](www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcenter-operations-management/overview.html) — Dramatically simplify performance, capacity and configuration management tasks to get more out of your virtual and cloud infrastructure.

During the Day One VMworld 2012 General Session, several notable blogs posts from the Office of the CTO and new Technical Whitepapers for the VMware vCloud Suite 5.1 were released:

###VMware Office of the CTO

* [The Software-Defined Datacenter meets VMworld](http://cto.vmware.com/the-software-defined-datacenter-meets-vmworld/) by Dr. Steve Herrod - Dr. Herrod focuses on the software-defined datacenter (SDDC). A software-defined datacenter is where all infrastructure is virtualized and delivered as a service, and the control of this datacenter is entirely automated by software. He disscuses the VMware vCloud Suite technologies available today and in the future such as Software-Defined Compute, Software-Defined Storage &amp; Availability, Software-Defined Networking &amp; Security, Management and Multi-Cloud.

* [Software-Defined Networking and Security](http://cto.vmware.com/unveiling-sdn-and-sdsec-architectures-at-vmworld-2012/) by Allwyn Sequeira - Sequeira discusses the key attributes of software-defined networking (SDN) and security (SDsec) the announcements from VMware on the networking and security front.

*  [Managing the Software-Defined Datacenter](http://cto.vmware.com/managing-the-software-defined-datacenter/) by Kit Colbert - Colbert discuses how the management of the software-defined datacenter is much different than in traditional systems.
