This past week I had the pleasure of joining the [ActualTech Media](http://actualtech.io) DemoCast moderated by [David Davis](https://twitter.com/davidmdavis). We did a quick review of VMware Cloud Foundation and jumped straight into demonstrating some of the key capabilities of the platform.

VMware Cloud Foundation delivers enterprise-ready cloud infrastructure by combining VMwareâ€™s highly scalable hyper-converged software (vSphere/VSAN) with the network management efficiency of NSX. VMware Cloud Foundation comes with unique lifecycle management capabilities that automate critical day 0 to day 2 operations for the cloud infrastructure stack, leading to a faster time to market, increase in productivity, and lower TCO.

Catch the replay of the [#DemoCast](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Democast?src=hash) and learn:

1.       How easy it is for VMware Cloud Foundation to establish the Software-Defined Data Center platform with vSphere, vSAN and NSX,
2.       How to create a new workload domain with SDDC Manager,
3.       How to expand workload domain with ease,
4.       And how SDDC Manager automates the patching and updating of unified SDDC platform - vSphere, vSAN and NSX!
