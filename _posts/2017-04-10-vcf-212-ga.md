On April 6th 2017, we released VMware Cloud Foundation 2.1.2 as a minor patch release. As a patch release, you’ll notice that the [release notes](http://pubs.vmware.com/Release_Notes/en/CloudFoundation/2-1-2/vcf-212-release-notes.html) are abbreviated and that the content of the VMware Cloud Foundation 2.1.1 [release notes](http://pubs.vmware.com/Release_Notes/en/CloudFoundation/2-1-1/vcf-211-release-notes.html) also applies to this release.

The patch bundle is now available through the Lifecycle Management feature in VMware Cloud Foundation’s SDDC Manager.
