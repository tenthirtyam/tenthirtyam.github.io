VMware Validated Designs are architectures and designs created and validated by VMware experts, encompassing the entire set of VMwareâ€™s Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) products. These provide standardized and streamlined designs for each deployment scenario and broad use-case to help build a Software-Defined Data Center: Data Center Foundation, Single-Region & Dual-Region IT Automation Cloud, QE / Demo Cloud and more. The designs are available in customer facing documentation (detailed deployment and operation guides, architecture installation walkthrough and more), service delivery kits and certified partner architectures. - See more at:
