<img src="/public/img/slowe-inside-small-02-150x150.png" alt="" title="Scott Lowe" width="150" height="150" />Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Scott Lowe, and this is my weblog about various technical subjects and the occasional personal topic.

### Personal Information

I live with my wife, Crystal, and our kids in the Denver, CO area. When I'm not working or spending time with my family, I'm enjoying the outdoor life or working in our church.

### Professional Information

I've been in the Information Technology field for 20 years, starting out with desktop support. Along the way, I worked as an instructor, a technical trainer and Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT), systems administrator, IT manager, systems engineer, consultant, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for a small start-up, and practice lead for a national VAR's VMware practice. Most recently, I worked as a forward-looking technologist for a large enterprise storage vendor based in the northeast US. Currently, I work as an engineering architect for VMware, focusing on network virtualization and software-defined networking (SDN).

In addition, I am a former contributor to [SearchVMware.com][1], a VMware-focused website with technical articles, how-to's, tips, and news. I also had some articles published on [SearchServerVirtualization.com][2] and I am a former columnist for [Virtualization Review][3] magazine.

I currently have six published books to my credit, all published by Wiley/Sybex:

*   *Mastering VMware vSphere 4*, published around VMworld 2009
*   *VMware vSphere 4 Administration Instant Reference* (with Jase McCarty and Matthew Johnson), published in late 2009
*   *VMware vSphere Design* (with Forbes Guthrie and Maish Saidel-Keesing), published in March 2011
*   *Mastering VMware vSphere 5*, published in October 2011
*   *VMware vSphere Design, 2nd Edition* (with Forbes Guthrie), published in March 2013 with updated content for vSphere 5.1 and vCloud Director
*   *Mastering VMware vSphere 5.5* (with Nick Marshall, who will now take over this series), published in November 2013

All six books are available from Amazon.com and other major booksellers.

My LinkedIn profile is available [here][4].
