# Hypertext Dispatches

This is 1030am. A collection of hypertext dispatches on technology, personal interests, and the noteworthy.

It is written by Ryan Johnson. An avid runner and technologist based in Tallahassee, Florida USA. Somewhat of a snarky guy, too.

Ryan is also a Staff Architect and Product Owner at VMware. As an accomplished solutions architect his focus is enabling customers and the community to accelerate and simplify their infrastructure services and organizations through the Software-Defined Data Center. He is a co-author of the Sybex/Wiley <strong>[Mastering vSphere 6.7](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Nick-Marshall/dp/1119512948)</strong> in which he collaborated with his fellow Solution Architects on the [VMware Validated Designs](http://vmware.com/go/vvd-docs) team.
